Concatenating videos with **ffmpeg** is quite annoying. I wrote a little script to automate most of that. However, it is not completed yet.

## Requirements

-   **ffmpeg**
-   a **node** environment

## Desired process

-   get/find videos to concatenate
-   get duration for each video
-   create _list.txt_
-   _ffmpeg -f concat â€¦_
-   output timestamps
